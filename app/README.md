# StudyCards

The StudyCards app is a study app designed for students that is built around the revision concept of ‘Active Memory Recall’. The app will primarily be composed of two main functions; ‘Record Question(s), and ‘Quiz Mode’. The ‘Record Questions’ mode will allow users to input questions they wish to be tested on. They will also have the options to enter the answer, categorise the questions subject, and rank the questions difficulty. The ‘Quiz Mode’ function will allow users to create a randomised quiz based on their question bank. The quiz will have the options to be based on all of their stored questions, or to only ask questions of a certain category or difficulty, as well as being timed or untimed. After each question, users will have to input the ‘correctness’ of their answer to proceed to the next question. (Correctness meaning – 1. Didn’t know, 2. Basic understanding, 3. Good understanding. 4. Confident of correct answer, 5. Comprehensive and Exhaustive answer)Users will be able to save and annotate a set of questions for future testing.

For extended features, users will have the option to export a question set or quiz set and send them to other users. This will require users to create an account.
A second extended feature – users will have the option to run a quiz set in ‘Smart Mode’ – where questions that a users answers correctly multiple times will be less likely to appear in subsequent quizzes.
